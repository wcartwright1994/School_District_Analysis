# School_District_Analysis
Performing analysis on the test scores based on an inquiry from the school board on the alteration of 9th grade reading and math test scores at Thomas High School.

**Overview of the School District Analysis**

The purpose of this analysis is to exclude the reading and math test scores from the 9th grade class at Thomas High School and, based on the new dataset, calculate the:
1. Average math score in the district
2. Average reading score in the district
3. Percentage of students in the district passing math (based on a minimum score of 70%)
4. Percentage of students in the district passing reading (based on a minimum score of 70%)
5. Percentage of students in the district passing math and reading (based on an average minimum score of 70%)

This analysis will be broken down in the following buckets:
1. School spending per student
2. School size
3. School type

**School District Analysis Results**

An analysis was run on the metrics above twice, once including the data from 9th grade student Thomas High School and once excluding the data from 9th grade student Thomas High School. The result were then compared and the following conclusions can be reached:
* The average math and reading scores did not change in a material fashion
* The average passing rates for math, reading, and overall did not change in a material fashion
* When grouped, the overall rates by spending per student, size, and type did not change in a material fashion
* Average math scores were approximately 200 bps higher for the 9th grade students at Thomas High School than the other classes
* Average reading scores were approximately 500 bps higher for the 9th grade students at Thomas High School than the other classes

**School District Analysis Summary**

Based off the required analysis by the school board, there were not material changes to the overall metrics by excluding the test results for the 9th grade students at Thomas High School.

Although the overall metrics did not show a material change, additional analysis should be completed on these scores against district averages. Additional steps taken can include:
* Defining outlier thresholds to include in future iterations of the script
* Comparing the average grades for the current 10th, 11th, and 12th grade classes at Thomas High School to determine if there are similar differences across other grades
* Comparing historical data for previous 9th grade classes at Thomas High School against the other classes in previous years
* Comparing historical data for the current 9th grade class during previous years to determine if the difference in grades has persisted over longer periods.
* Performing on an analysis on a student level to determine if higher averages are because of:
  * More students performing well at higher rates
  * Less students performing poorly
  * More students performing at an "average" level

In this situation, even if the class is found to be an outlier, this statistical method cannot be used to prove academic dishonesty. Additional steps will need to be taken by the school district to determine the root cause for the higher test scores compared to other students in the district.
